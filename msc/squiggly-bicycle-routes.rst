   Direct and squiggly routes have time and energy costs for bicyclists.

Description
===========

Bicyclists choose routes at least partially based on the travel time and the
energy required to traverse the route. Grade changes, wind, stop signs, traffic
signal timing, rough pavement, undulations, etc. all contribute to the time and
energy costs. Urban planners and civil engineers design infrastructure and
routes for bicyclists that have specific time and energy costs associated with
them. In fact, automobile routes and infrastructure often have more preferable
time and energy costs than the parallel bicycle routes and infrastructure.
These bicycle routes are quite squiggly and are not optimizing the convenience
of the bicyclists over the automobile drive. Using simple physics-based
simulations, existing and future routes and infrastructure designs can be
evaluated for time and energy costs. This puts a clear quantitative numbers to
important aspects of the convenience of bicycling.

The goal of this project is to 1) develop a realistic yet simple simulation of
a bicyclist traversing a route that considers all major influences to time and
energy costs of the rider, 2) evaluate several case studies using the
simulation and demonstrate how route designs can be improved with minor changes
to designed elements, 3) propose simple guidelines for planners, and 4) develop
an open source web application that allows planners to evaluate routes with
respect to time and energy costs.

Proposed Approach
=================

- Review the transportation literature for related research (time costs, energy
  costs, bicyclist convenience, route & infrastructure design, standards & codes)
- Develop a 2D mathematical and computational simulation model that can
  realistically traverse routes.
- Find or collect route data based on existing routes, automobile routes, and
  design plans.
- Evaluate the routes and interpret the results.
- Propose simple design guidelines based on the results that will generally
  help lower time and energy costs.
- Develop a web application that accepts route information, simulates the
  route, and presents the resulting time and energy costs.

Required Skills
===============

- Modeling 2D dynamics
- GIS for transportation
- Simulation of vehicle dynamics
- Web application development
