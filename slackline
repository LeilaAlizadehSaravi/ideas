Title: Mental stress assessment before and after slackline training in elementary school children 
Impact of sports on education
Coordinated kinematics, muscle synergies and EEG

1.	Key Objectives/Hypothesis
Our aims are to investigate whether slackline training improves the educational performance in elementary school children.
We hypothesized that:
•	Slackline training will improve the balance performance and balance coordination in school children, optimize muscle activity, increase duration of balancing or walking on a slackline
•	Long-term training will reduce the mental stress and improves their focus. 


We will test these hypotheses by:
(I)	comparing balance performance and the mechanical and neural control of slacklining between trained and untrained control group.
(II)	quantifying changes in balance performance and mechanical and neural control, after 6 weeks of training.
(III)	quantifying changes in educational performance and focus after 6 weeks of training.
(IV)	correlating changes in slacklining performance with changes in mental state and educational performance.
Primary outcome:
•	Time to stay balanced on slackline
•	Duration to walk on the slackline 
•	Exam result of multiple choice test while sitting behind the computer clicking with mouse 
Measurements:
•	EEG, alpha waves 
•	EMG whole body
•	Kinematics co-ordination whole body 

Measurement of EMG and Kinematics during slacklining.
Measurement of EEG while seated, during multiple choice test.
